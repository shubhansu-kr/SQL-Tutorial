# SQL

I took the [freeCodeCampOrg](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp)'s [SQL Tutorial](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY) to learn the basics of SQL. 

[SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY): is a beginner friendly SQL tutorial(no prerequisite) hosted for free on youtube. 
This course covers database management basics and SQL using the MySQL RDBMS. 
Throughout the course various topics including schema design, basic C.R.U.D operations, aggregation, nested queries, joins, keys and much more are covered.
